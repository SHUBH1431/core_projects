### 5. Yulu Hypothesis Testing: Understanding Factors Affecting Cycle Demand
- **File**: [YULU_HYPOTHESIS.pdf](./YULU_HYPOTHESIS.pdf)  
- **Description**: Statistical analysis of Yuluâ€™s bike-sharing demand in India, using T-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-Square tests to measure the influence of working days, seasons, and weather conditions on usage.  
- **Extended Description**: This case study evaluates 10,886 records of Yulu cycle usage to uncover demand drivers. Results showed no significant difference in demand between working and non-working days, strong seasonal effects, and weather-based variations in ridership. Chi-Square tests confirmed that weather depends on season, reflecting their combined influence on demand. Recommendations include seasonal fleet adjustments, weather-based promotions, and operational strategies to ensure consistent availability and improved customer engagement.

### 6. Delhivery Case Study: Feature Engineering for Logistics Optimization
- **File**: [delhivery_feature_engineering.pdf](./delhivery_feature_engineering.pdf)  
- **Description**: Preprocessing and feature engineering on logistics trip data to prepare for forecasting models, including handling missing values, aggregation, outlier detection, encoding, and scaling.  
- **Extended Description**: This project explores Delhiveryâ€™s logistics dataset of 144,000+ records to engineer features for predictive modeling. The process involved cleaning missing data, splitting source/destination into granular components, aggregating trip data, and applying encoding/scaling techniques. Insights revealed gaps between actual vs expected delivery times, busiest delivery corridors, and strong distanceâ€“time relationships. Recommendations include optimizing key corridors, leveraging engineered features for forecasting, and incorporating external signals (traffic, weather) for better logistics planning.
